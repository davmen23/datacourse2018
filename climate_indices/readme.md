## Bugs
 1. If you find a bug please report it to the group that is responsible for the function.
 2. If you have a Github account, you can create an `Issue` here and everybody can work on the problem.

## Updates

 1. You can provide updates of your R function by e-mail. Just send the new code to the lecturer.
 2. If you have a Github account you can a) `fork` the repository and then b) `commit` changes and create a `pull request` to be reviewed by the lecturers.
 
## Master script for all indices

Based on `climate_indices.R` volunteers can now develop a little helper script to calculate all indices (averages and rate of change) at once. Please contribute to that group work, if you have some time left ;)
